# free-for-dev
Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers but it can be hard to find them all in order to make informed decisions.

This then is a list of software, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS etc offerings that have free tiers for devs.  

You can help by sending Pull Requests to add more services. Once I have a good set of link in this README file I'll look into a better layout for the information and links, help with that appreciated too.

If you're not inclined to make PRs you can tweet me at ```@ripienaar```
